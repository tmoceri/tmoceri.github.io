	<h1> Which two websites are you most inspired by? </h1>
		<p> I picked two sites that don't necessarily inspire me, but demonstrate different website styles of locally-based design studios: <a href="http://www.theworkdept.com/"> The Work Department</a> and <a href="http://hakdesignstudio.com/"> HAK Design Studio</a>. </p>
	<h1> How do they exhibit effective use of space, size or balance? </h1>
		<h2> The Work Department </h2>

			<p> The Work Department website uses colors to bring distinct attention to each link in the navigation bar. The site also uses lots of space and large font to draw the users eyes to the page title, "Our Work." Images of projects then draw users down the page through numerous project examples. The website seems to use columns, but then allows the various shapes and sizes of the images to direct the flow sometimes staying within the columns, but oftentimes playfully interacting with them. The images in the first row change as new projects are added. Smaller images create more white space and may not draw in the user in the same way larger, more visually interesting images would. </p>
		<h2> HAK Design Studio </h2>
			<img src="img/hak_design_studio.png" alt="HAK Design Studio" style="width:304px;height:228px">
			<p> HAK Design Studio also uses space, color and large, bold font to draw the user to a list of custom offerings. Unfortunately, the font does not help to draw distinction between the offerings. The list isn't interactive and doesn't do much to direct the user further.</p>   
	<h1> What makes them similar and different? </h1> 
		<p>While both websites have simple layouts, The Work Department website is more playful and sophisticated in its design. </p>
	<h1> Thumbnail sketches </h1>
